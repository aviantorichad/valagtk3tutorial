This is an introductory tutorial on programming for the GNOME platform using
[GTK+3](http://www.gtk.org) in [Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Vala). It is based
on and will closely follow the excellent
[GTK+2.0 tutorial](http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/2.90/) written by
Tony Gale, Ian Main, and the GTK team.

I will attempt to cover new GTK+ concepts introduced in version 3.0, as well
as best practices when writing real-world projects.
